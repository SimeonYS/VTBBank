Euro und kann auf ein Gewinnwachstum von rund 30 Prozent \u00fcber die vergangenen drei Jahre zur\u00fcckblicken.

Die VTB Direktbank ist als Zweigniederlassung der VTB Bank (Austria) AG im deutschen Privatkundenmarkt vertreten und blickt auf ein erfolgreiches erstes Gesch\u00e4ftsjahr zur\u00fcck.  Beide Unternehmen - VTB Bank (Deutschland) AG und VTB Direktbank - geh\u00f6ren zur European Subholding der VTB Bank (Austria) AG in Wien. W\u00e4hrend die VTB Bank (Deutschland) AG bereits seit \u00fcber 40 Jahren als Spezial-Bank f\u00fcr deutsch-russische Handelsbeziehungen erfolgreich ist, konnte sich die im April 2011 gegr\u00fcndete VTB Direktbank innerhalb der vergangenen zw\u00f6lf Monate zu einer festen Gr\u00f6\u00dfe im deutschen Direktbankenmarkt entwickeln und hat sich in dieser kurzen Zeit als einer der f\u00fchrenden Anbieter von flexiblen Sparprodukten etabliert.  \u201eDer VTB Direktbank ist es gelungen, sich schnell und nachhaltig im deutschen Retail-Markt zu etablieren\", freut sich Axel Breitbach, Vorstand der VTB Bank (Deutschland) AG, und erg\u00e4nzt: \u201eDie Strategie der VTB Direktbank, konsequent Neu- und Bestandskunden in allen kurz-, mittel- und langfristigen Laufzeiten attraktive Konditionen anzubieten, zahlt sich aus. Dies spiegelt sich auch in den positiven Bewertungen der Stiftung Warentest wider und dem Zuspruch seitens der Kunden. Wir gratulieren der VTB Direktbank ganz herzlich zu dieser positiven Entwicklung.\"  Im April 2011 startete die VTB Direktbank mit ihrem Tages- und Festgeld-Angebot. Seither wurde das Produktangebot kontinuierlich durch verschiedene Festgeld-Laufzeiten und individuelle Zinsauszahlungsrhythmen erweitert. So bietet die VTB Direktbank f\u00fcr s\u00e4mtliche Festgeld-Laufzeiten j\u00e4hrliche oder monatliche Zinszahlungen an und kombiniert mit dem VTB Duo sogar die Vorz\u00fcge eines Tages- und Festgeldkontos  Im Gro\u00dfen Zinstest der Januar-Ausgabe 2012 der Zeitschrift Finanztest wurden die Angebote von 94 Banken bewertet - die VTB Direktbank \u00fcberzeugte nicht nur als einer der Testsieger im Bereich \u201eFestgeld/Sparbrief drei Jahre\", sondern auch in der Kategorie \u201eKombiprodukte\".  Aber auch die von der VTB Direktbank eingesetzte \u201eOnline-Filiale\" auf Basis des Bankensystems \u201ebank21\" erf\u00fcllt \u00fcberdurchschnittlich alle Kriterien f\u00fcr eine benutzerfreundliche Anwendung. Kunden der VTB Direktbank k\u00f6nnen ihre Transaktionen nicht nur sicher, sondern auch intuitiv, unkompliziert und schnell durchf\u00fchren - offiziell best\u00e4tigt durch das Pr\u00fcfsiegel des T\u00dcV IT.  \u201eF\u00fcr uns z\u00e4hlt vor allem, dass wir unseren Kunden ein sicheres und unkompliziertes Online-Banking anbieten k\u00f6nnen.\", freut sich Bernd H\u00fclsmann, Manager Operations & IT der VTB Direktbank. \u201eEs zahlt sich aus, dass wir unsere online-Anwendungen t\u00e4glich pr\u00fcfen und im Sinne der Kunden optimieren. Das Pr\u00fcfsiegel des T\u00dcV IT gibt unseren Kunden dabei die Gewissheit, dass das Online-Banking der VTB Direktbank einfach, benutzerfreundlich und sicher ist.\"  Direktbanken gelten als die derzeitigen Gewinner im Bankenmarkt. In den letzten zehn Jahren erreichten Direktbanken in Deutschland mehr als 14 Millionen Kunden und einen Marktanteil bei den Sichteinlagen von 20 Prozent. Schon bald werden drei Viertel der Deutschen das Internet nutzen - und damit werden sie gleichzeitig zu potentiellen Kunden f\u00fcr Direktbanken. Experten prognostizieren weiteres Wachstum und erwarten zunehmenden Wettbewerb in den n\u00e4chsten Jahren.  Magnus Eger, verantwortlich f\u00fcr das Marketing der VTB Direktbank, sieht dieser Entwicklung positiv entgegen: \u201eAls auf attraktive und sichere Spareinlagen spezialisierte Online-Bank werden wir auch zuk\u00fcnftig versuchen, Sparer von unseren Angeboten zu \u00fcberzeugen. Dazu ben\u00f6tigt man attraktive Produkte, einen schnellen und sicheren Service und eine solide Reputation - in allen Bereichen ist die VTB insgesamt bestens aufgestellt. Vor allem hat es sich f\u00fcr uns ausgezahlt, als neue Online-Bank eine offene und transparente Kommunikation mit unseren Kunden zu pflegen. Dazu geh\u00f6rt, dass die VTB Direktbank nicht nur gute Konditionen, sondern auch immer das ein oder andere Highlight anbietet - das Jubil\u00e4ums-Startguthaben, die VTB Festgeldwochen und erst k\u00fcrzlich das Oster-Spezial belegen diesen Ansatz.\"  F\u00fcr 2013 ist sowohl f\u00fcr die VTB Bank (Deutschland) AG als auch f\u00fcr die VTB Direktbank der Bezug eines neuen Firmengeb\u00e4udes am Finanzplatz Frankfurt vorgesehen. Auf die Bedeutung dieses Vorhabens verweist der Vorstandschef der VTB Bank (Deutschland) AG, Dr. Valeriy Lyakin und verkn\u00fcpft die Historie des Unternehmens mit einem positiven Zukunftsausblick. \u201eDie VTB Gruppe denkt wachstumsorientiert und langfristig, das soll ab 2013 auch nach au\u00dfen deutlich werden.

Wir freuen uns, dass wir zusammen mit der VTB Direktbank die Kompetenzen aus Corporate und Retail Banking in einem gemeinsamen Firmengeb\u00e4ude vereinigen.\"  Michael Kramer, Niederlassungsleiter der VTB Direktbank blickt daher optimistisch in die Zukunft: \"R\u00fcckblickend d\u00fcrfen wir mit unserem ersten Jahr sehr zufrieden sein. Die VTB Direktbank ist vor einem Jahr mit gro\u00dfem Interesse und ehrgeizigen Zielen an den deutschen Markt gekommen und m\u00f6chte sich seither im deutschen Umfeld als ein verl\u00e4sslicher Partner pr\u00e4sentieren. Eine der Kernausrichtungen der VTB Direktbank ist dabei der Aufbau von langfristigen Kundenbeziehungen, sowie eine professionelle und sehr zielorientierte Betreuung der Kunden. Wir haben es geschafft, die VTB Direktbank im deutschen Privatkundenmarkt zu etablieren und als f\u00fchrenden Anbieter f\u00fcr Online Sparprodukte zu positionieren.\"  Die VTB Direktbank auf einen Blick  Die VTB Direktbank ist eine Zweigniederlassung der \u00f6sterreichischen VTB Bank (Austria) AG.

VTB Bank (Austria) AG, VTB Bank (Deutschland) AG und VTB Bank (France) SA, were merged into the newly created VTB Bank (Europe) SE, which operates under a single banking license.  The decision to adopt an innovative legal form of SE or Societas Europaea \u2014 a company registered in accordance with the corporate law of the European Union, is consistent with VTB strategy in developing Group\u2019s presence in Europe, VTB Group\u2019s commitment to one of the core regions outside of Russia.  With the head office in Frankfurt am Main, the new structure will also include a branch in Vienna. VTB Direktbank will be part of the VTB Bank (Europe) SE. The office in Paris has been closed.  The merger process, including closure of the office in France and the registration of the branch in Austria, has been approved by the European Central Bank and the local regulators.  The reorganisation will lay the groundwork for a strategic realignment by the bank, in which a consistent legal, business and support infrastructure is created. This centralisation will allow the bank to make its entire product portfolio available to all clients across Europe, to attract the best talent to our bank and to optimise the resources. The cost savings of the restructuring will amount to approximately EUR40 mln annually (or approximately 40% of the current cost base). The new setup also enables significant efficiencies in managing liquidity and capital resources.  Yuri Soloviev, First Deputy President and Chairman of VTB Bank Management Board, said: \"We are the first Russian banking group and among the first banks in Europe to transform our organisational structure into that of a Societas Europaea or SE. This represents a clear commitment to Europe in general and to Frankfurt as its financial centre in particular.
